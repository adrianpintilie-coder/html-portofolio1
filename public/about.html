    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Adrian Pintilie and I'm a passionate Software Engineer. I'm currently based in Atherstone, United Kingdom. </p>

    <p>Since 2025, I've enjoyed turning complex problems into easy solutions. Beeing a self-taught programmer made me learn how to research, find and choose the most efficient solutions for the problems that i encountered. </p>

    <p>When I'm not pushing pixels. you'll find me cooking, biking, reading or working out at gym.</p>
